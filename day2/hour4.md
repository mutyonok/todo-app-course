# DAY 2 HOUR 4: MARK COMPLETE TOGGLE

## 5-MINUTE RETRIEVAL PRACTICE

1. How do you create a button element with JavaScript?
2. What property do you use to access an element's parent?
3. What's the difference between `textContent` and `innerHTML`?

---

## ðŸŽ¯ GOAL
Make tasks toggle between complete (crossed out) and incomplete when clicked. Learn CSS class manipulation for visual state changes.

---

## ðŸ’¡ WHAT WE'RE ACHIEVING

Users can add and delete tasks, but can't mark progress. You'll make clicking a task toggle it between complete/incomplete with visual feedback (strikethrough, changed color). This requires CSS class manipulation and understanding event targets.

---

## THE APPROACH: CLICK-TO-TOGGLE PATTERN

**User interaction:**
- Click task text â†’ add strikethrough (mark complete)
- Click again â†’ remove strikethrough (mark incomplete)
- Click delete button â†’ remove task (should NOT toggle)

We say we change the **STATE** of the task.

---

## ðŸ“– KEY CONCEPT: STATE MANAGEMENT WITH CSS CLASSES

**The pattern:** Use CSS classes to represent different states, then toggle (add or remove) them with JavaScript.

**Common UI states:**
- `completed` / `done` - Task finished
- `active` - Currently selected item
- `disabled` - Non-interactive element
- `hidden` - Invisible element
- `error` - Invalid input
- `loading` - Fetching data

**Why not inline styles?**
- `element.style.textDecoration = 'line-through'` works, but doesn't scale
- CSS classes keep styling in CSS files (separation of concerns)
- Easy to add multiple style changes at once (color, opacity, decoration, etc.)
- Professional codebases use class-based state management

**The classList API:**

To manipulate classes from Javascript, we should use DOM element's `.classList` property.

We can add, remove, toggle CSS classes on any element and check if element has a CSS class.

```javascript
element.classList.add('class-name');     // Add class
element.classList.remove('class-name');  // Remove class
element.classList.toggle('class-name');  // Add if absent, remove if present
element.classList.contains('class-name'); // Check if class exists
```

**Why this matters:** This is exactly how React, Vue, and all modern frameworks handle state-driven styling. You're learning the foundational pattern.

---

## TASK 1: Create CSS for Completed State (8 min)

**Goal:** Define how completed tasks should look.

In your CSS, create a `.completed` class (or `.done`, `.checked`, whatever name you prefer).

**Suggested styling:**
- Text decoration: line-through (crossed out text)
- Color: lighter gray (#888, #999) to show it's done
- Optional: Reduced opacity (0.6-0.7) for subtle fade effect

**Success check:** No visual change yet (you haven't applied the class), but CSS is written

**âžœ Understanding check:** Why create a class instead of directly manipulating styles with JavaScript?

---

## TASK 2: Add Toggle to Task Click (15 min)

**Goal:** Clicking a task adds/removes the `completed` class.

**Your task:** Add a click listener to the `<li>` element that toggles the `completed` class.

**Try it yourself first.** After 12 minutes, if stuck, ask Claude: "How do I add a click listener to an li element that toggles a CSS class?"

**Success check:**
- Click a task â†’ it gets crossed out
- Click again â†’ strikethrough disappears
- Can toggle any task multiple times

**âžœ Understanding check:** What happens if you click very quickly multiple times? Does it toggle each time?

---

## TASK 3: Understanding Event Propagation (20 min)

**The problem:** Right now, clicking the delete button toggles the task AND deletes it. We only want the delete.

**Technical challenge:** Both task and button are clickable, both inside the `<li>`. 

You need to ensure:
1. Clicking task text toggles complete state
2. Clicking delete button does NOT toggle (only deletes)

### Part A: Visualize the Problem (8 min)

**Concept: Event Bubbling**

When you click the delete button, the click "bubbles up":
1. Button receives click
2. Click bubbles to parent `<li>`
3. `<li>` receives click and toggles

**Your task - Make it visible:**

1. In your delete button's click handler, add at the very top:
   ```javascript
   console.log('Delete button clicked');
   ```

2. In your `<li>`'s click handler, add at the very top:
   ```javascript
   console.log('Li clicked');
   ```

3. Open DevTools console
4. Click the delete button
5. Observe: You see BOTH messages! "Delete button clicked" then "Li clicked"

**Try it:**
- Click delete button â†’ see both logs
- Click task text (not button) â†’ see only "Li clicked"

This proves the click is bubbling from button to parent.

**âžœ Understanding check:** Why does clicking the button trigger both handlers?

---

### Part B: Stop the Bubbling (12 min)

**The solution: we can stop an event to propagate to parent elements**

The `event` object has method `.stopPropagation()`, when called - event stops "bubbling".

```javascript
button.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  event.stopPropagation(); // Stop click from bubbling to parent
  console.log('Delete button clicked');
  // Delete logic here
});
```

**Your task:**

1. Add `event.stopPropagation();` as the FIRST line in your delete button's click handler (before the console.log)
2. Save and test
3. Click delete button â†’ should only see "Delete button clicked" (not "Li clicked")
4. The task should delete WITHOUT toggling

**Success check:**
- Clicking delete button shows only one console log
- Task deletes WITHOUT toggling completion
- Clicking task text still toggles and shows "Li clicked"

**Clean up:** Remove or comment out both console.log statements once you understand.

**âžœ Understanding check:** What would happen if you put `stopPropagation()` AFTER the delete logic instead of before?

---

## TASK 4: Improve Toggle Target (12 min)

**Current issue:** The entire `<li>` is clickable, including empty space around the button. This might confuse users.

**Better UX:** Only toggle when clicking task text, not the container - `<li>`.

We can only add event listeners to DOM elements. That means the task text must be inside its own element.  

**The approach:**
1. Wrap task text in a `<span>` element
2. Move toggle listener from `<li>` to `<span>`
3. Keep delete button separate

**Previous structure:**
```
<li>
  Task text here
  <button class="delete-btn">Delete</button>
</li>
```


**New structure:**
```
<li>
  <span class="task-text">Task text here</span>
  <button class="delete-btn">Delete</button>
</li>
```

**Your task:**
1. Instead of setting the text to `<li>` we need to create a new `<span>` element for task text
2. Move the click listener from li to the span element
3. Append span as child `<li>` (before the button)

**Success check:**
- Clicking task text toggles completion
- Clicking delete button only deletes
- Clicking empty space in `<li>` does nothing

**âžœ Understanding check:** Why is wrapping text in a span better than keeping the listener on the `<li>`?

---

## TASK 5: Add Visual Feedback (10 min)

**Goal:** Make it obvious tasks are clickable.

**For task text span:**
- Cursor: pointer (shows hand cursor)
- Optional: Add hover effect (slight color change or underline)

**Success check:**
- Task text shows pointer cursor on hover
- Completion toggle has smooth animation
- Clear visual feedback that text is interactive

---

## SUCCESS CHECKS - ALL MUST PASS

âœ… Clicking task text toggles completed state  
âœ… Completed tasks show strikethrough  
âœ… Clicking again removes strikethrough  
âœ… Delete button does NOT toggle when clicked  
âœ… Delete button removes task without affecting complete state  
âœ… Task text shows pointer cursor  
âœ… Can toggle and delete tasks in any combination  
âœ… Visual feedback is clear and smooth

---

## EXIT TICKET

1. **In your own words:** What does `classList.toggle()` do?
2. **Explain:** Why do we need `event.stopPropagation()` in the delete handler?
3. **Predict:** If you toggle a task complete, then refresh the page, will it still be marked complete? Why or why not?

---

## ðŸŽ¯ WHAT YOU ACCOMPLISHED

You've implemented state management with CSS classes and handled complex event interactions. The app is now fully functional - users can add, complete, and delete tasks. This is a complete todo app! The only limitation: tasks disappear on refresh (you'll fix that tomorrow with localStorage).

**Tomorrow (Day 3):** Make tasks persist between sessions using localStorage and learn the data-driven UI pattern.

---

## ðŸŽ‰ END OF DAY 2 MILESTONE

**You built a working interactive app in one day!**

Test everything:
- Add several tasks
- Mark some complete
- Delete some tasks
- Toggle tasks multiple times
- Try edge cases (empty input, very long text)

**Commit your work:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add delete and complete toggle functionality"
git push
```

**Refresh your GitHub Pages site** - your deployed app now has full interactivity!

---

## IF YOU FINISH EARLY

1. Add a "complete all" button that toggles all tasks to completed
2. Add a counter showing "X tasks completed"
3. Try double-click to toggle instead of single-click
4. Experiment: What happens if you add the `completed` class in HTML before JavaScript runs?
5. Add a different visual style for completed tasks (background color change, different icon)
